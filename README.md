## MongoDB versus Mongoose

![tumblr_nbhme6bafu1s02vreo1_500](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4304660/16811532/b08865a8-48dd-11e6-9474-c114b2e8a00d.gif)

`MongoDB` is a no-SQL database. It is responsible for storing data in containers and making sure that the data is safe and organized. MongoDB stores data in BSON, "a binary JSON format." We'll see SQL databases later that store data in a format more like an Excel spreadsheet. 

`Mongoose` is a library or "wrapper" that gives us a bunch of convenience methods for working with MongoDB records (kind of like jQuery's convenience methods for manipulating the DOM). Generally we will not be interacting _directly_ with MongoDB, instead we'll be working through `mongoose`.

<details><summary>Side-note: Wondering what makes noSQL different from SQL? (we'll talk more about this later)</summary>

There are two main categories of databases: relational (SQL) databases, and non-relational (no-SQL) databases. Mongo is a no-SQL database that stores entries in a JSON-like format.

Since MongoDB is the first database we've worked with it's hard for us to discuss the tradeoffs between SQL/no-SQL. But here's a great analogy from StackOverflow:

> "NoSQL databases store information like you would recipes in a book. When you want to know how to make a cake, you go to that recipe, and all of the information about how to make that cake (ingredients, preparation, mixing, baking, finishing, etc.) are all on that one page.
>
> SQL is like shopping for the ingredients for the recipe. In order to get all of your ingredients into your cart, you have to go to many different aisles to get each ingredient. When you are done shopping, your grocery cart will be full of all the ingredients you had to run around and collect.
>
> Wouldn’t it be nicer if there was a store that was organized by recipe, so you could go to one place in the store and grab everything you need from that one spot? Granted you’ll find ingredients like eggs in 50 different places, so there’s a bit of overhead when stocking the shelves, but from a consumer standpoint it would be much easier/faster to find what they're looking for."

## Schemas and Models

Mongoose presents us with two key concepts for how we create and store data in our MongoDB database.

**[Schema](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html)**: A Schema is a diagram or blueprint for what every object in the noSQL database will contain. It does not include any methods, just placeholders for what data you will eventually store. Here's an example of a simple Address Book mongoose schema:

```js
var ContactSchema = new Schema({
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    address: String,
    phoneNumber: Number,
    email: String,
    professionalContact: Boolean
});
```

With the above Schema, we can expect that all of our Address Book entries would have a first name, last name, address, and email address in the form of Strings. We can count on the phoneNumber to always be accepted, stored, and returned as a number. Lastly, the boolean value of Professional Contact will always be a true or false. A Schema has no functionality. It simply defines the shape of the data that we will expect when we work with contacts.

**[Model](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html)**: A mongoose model is compiled from a Schema. It takes in the structure and shape of a Schema and adds the capacity to perform actions such as reading, saving, updating, etc. The Schema is just an inert mould to make sure that the models will hold the data consistently. A model is actually capable of creating new entries in a database and retrieving data from the database. Here's how you'd make a Contact model out of our Contact Schema:

```js
var Contact = mongoose.model('Contact', ContactSchema);
```

> In mongoose, a schema represents the structure of a particular document, either completely or just a portion of the document. It's a way to express expected properties and values as well as constraints and indexes. A model defines a programming interface for interacting with the database (read, insert, update, etc). So a schema answers "what will the data in this collection look like?" and a model provides functionality like "Are there any records matching this query?" or "Add a new document to the collection".

Factory metaphor: Imagine a factory that has a mold for making rubber ducks. The mold would be the Schema. The machine that is capable of putting the different colored plastic into the mold, pressing it, and delivering a new toy to the world would be the model. The toy itself would be the data that would now be stored in your database.

## MongoDB & Mongoose setup

Let's do a quick activity and get Mongoose and MongoDB running.

1. Assuming you already have MongoDB installed (you did this at installfest), to get started using mongoose in a project, we have to install it to add it to a project's `package.json`:

  ```bash
    npm install --save mongoose
  ```

2. Next we need to `require` Mongoose in our project and `connect` to the MongoDB service (it could be local or hosted). We can do this in `server.js` for now. Later we'll do it in `models/index.js`.

  ```js
    var mongoose = require('mongoose');
    mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/todo-app');
  ```

    <details>
      <summary>What's a connection string?</summary>
      `mongodb://localhost/todo-app-demo` is a string to connect to a MongoDB database on your local system named `todo-app-demo`. You can name the system whatever you like and it will be created as soon as you save some data to it.
    </details>

3. Finally, we need to run the MongodDB service. Generally you will want it open in a separate tab, running in the background.

  ```bash
    mongod
  ```

    **Note:** If you already have an instance of MongoDB running, you'll get an error at this step. If that's the case, you can move on to the next step, since MongoDB is already running!

Running your MongoDB service is no different from running your Express Server!


## Todo App Integration
Once you've finished the above steps, here's how you would set up an Express application with a "Todo" model (so we can start CRUDing todos!). Look in the directory `starter-code` for a starting point.

1. We'll need a `Todo` model, which we will set up in a file called `todo.js`....

2. <details>
  <summary>In your model file (e.g. `todo.js`), create the model **schema**, and export it so that you can require it in other parts of your app.</summary>
  ```js
  var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
    Schema = mongoose.Schema;

  var TodoSchema = new Schema({
    task: String,
    description: String
  });

  var Todo = mongoose.model('Todo', TodoSchema);

  module.exports = Todo;
  ```
</details>

3. <details>
  <summary>In `server.js`, require your model.</summary>
  ```js
  // server.js
  // Note without requiring your models you can't use them in server.js!
  var Todo = require('./models/todo');
  ```
</details>

#### Database IDs and data-types

Most databases also require that we specify the data type for each attribute.  In mongoose we can use data types from JavaScript, such as String, Number, and even Array. Here's a list of all the [available data-types](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html) in mongoose.

Let's look at this example, using the `console.js` file to help us interact with our database.

```js
// models/person.js
var mongoose = require('mongoose'),
  Schema = mongoose.Schema;

var personSchema = new Schema({
    firstName: String,
    lastName: String,
    height: Number,
    superPower: String,
    weakness: String,
    isExcited: Boolean
});

var Person = mongoose.model('Person', personSchema);

module.exports = Person;

```

In the above, note how we've assigned **String**, **Number** and even a **Boolean** as the data types for this Schema.

The schema is useless by itself.  Let's create a model so we can start interacting with data.

```js
  // models/index.js
  var Person = require('./models/person');
```

Now in the console file (fixing any errors you get), try making a single instance of a Person with the code below:

```js
  var ilias = new Person({
      firstName: "Ilias",
      lastName: "Tsangaris",
      height: 6.0,
      superPower: "Puppy",
      weakness: "Puppy",
      isExcited: true
  });

  ilias.save(function(err, newPerson) {
    if(err) { return console.log(err) }
    console.log("saved new person: ", newPerson);
  });
```

The above logs to the terminal the `newPerson` success object:

```bash
saved new person:  {
  __v: 0,
  firstName: "Ilias",
  lastName: "Tsangaris",
  height: 6.0,
  superPower: "Puppy",
  weakness: "Puppy",
  isExcited: true
  _id: 57866b9f9d89c840336a135e }

```

>Note: Every model instance that we store in the database is assigned an ID. In MongoDB, IDs have a key of `_id` and a value that is a 24-character string.  We can use this ID later to look up a particular record. Later on we'll look at how we can use those IDs can help us form relationships in the database.

## CRUD Operations with Mongoose

Until now, when we wanted to access or manipulate stored data on our server, we worked with an array. We were sending around the whole array, finding single objects in an array, adding objects to an array, and deleting elements from an array.

<details>
  <summary>At what API route did we complete each of the above?</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      sending along the whole array: GET /todos
    </li>
    <li>
      finding single objects in an array: GET /todos/:id
    </li>
    <li>
      adding objects to an array: POST /todos
    </li>
    <li>
      deleting elements from an array: DELETE /todos/:id
    </li>
</details>


Luckily, Mongoose provides methods to access the database data which will help us accomplish these tasks.

#### Get all todos: `.find()`

<details>
  <summary>We can use <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.find"  target="_blank">.find()</a> to get all documents in the collection.</summary>
  ```js
  // get all todos
  app.get('/api/todos', function(req, res) {
    // find all todos in db
    Todo.find({}, function(err, allTodos) {
      res.json({ todos: allTodos });
    });
  });
  ```

  **Note:** We can also use `.find()` to get a specific set of documents in the collection (rather than ALL documents) by setting conditions. Read more <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.find"  target="_blank">in the docs</a>.
</details>

#### Create new todo: `new` and `.save()`

<details>
  <summary>
  We've seen the `new` keyword before! It creates new instances of an object. We use it here to create new instances of our `Todo` model. We then call `.save()` to store the new todo in our database.</summary>
  ```js
  // create new todo
  app.post('/api/todos', function(req, res) {
    // create new todo with form data (`req.body`)
    var newTodo = new Todo(req.body);

    // save new todo in db
    newTodo.save(function(err, savedTodo) {
      res.json(savedTodo);
    });
  });
  ```
</details>

#### Get one todo: `.findOne()`

<details>
  <summary>We can use <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query_Query-findOne">.findOne()</a> to return the first document in the collection that matches certain criteria. In this case, we're looking for a todo that has a certain `_id`.</summary>
  ```js
  // get one todo
  app.get('/api/todos/:id', function(req, res) {
    // get todo id from url params (`req.params`)
    var todoId = req.params.id;

    // find todo in db by id
    Todo.findOne({ _id: todoId }, function(err, foundTodo) {
      res.json(foundTodo);
    });
  });
  ```

  **Note:** The <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findById" target="_blank">.findById()</a> method will also return a single document matching a specified id field.
</details>

#### Update todo: `.findOne()` and `.save()`

<details>
  <summary>Similar to the last example, we can use `.findOne()` to find the document with a certain `_id`. After updating the document, we use `.save()` to persist our changes to the database.</summary>
  ```js
  // update todo
  app.put('/api/todos/:id', function(req, res) {
    // get todo id from url params (`req.params`)
    var todoId = req.params.id;

    // find todo in db by id
    Todo.findOne({ _id: todoId }, function(err, foundTodo) {
      // update the todos's attributes
      foundTodo.task = req.body.task;
      foundTodo.description = req.body.description;

      // save updated todo in db
      foundTodo.save(function(err, savedTodo) {
        res.json(savedTodo);
      });
    });
  });
  ```
</details>

#### Delete todo: `.findOneAndRemove()`

<details>
  <summary>The <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.findOneAndRemove" target="_blank">.findOneAndRemove()</a> method takes care of finding the document with a certain `_id` and removing it from the database.</summary>
  ```js
  // delete todo
  app.delete('/api/todos/:id', function(req, res) {
    // get todo id from url params (`req.params`)
    var todoId = req.params.id;

    // find todo in db by id and remove
    Todo.findOneAndRemove({ _id: todoId }, function(err, deletedTodo) {
      res.json(deletedTodo);
    });
  });
  ```
  **Note:** Another way to remove the document is by finding the document first (using `.findOne()` or  `.findById()`) and calling <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#model_Model.remove" target="_blank">`.remove()`</a>.
