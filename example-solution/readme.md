**Objective:** Use Express to make a RESTful API for a to do list. Build a client for your app that uses AJAX and Handlebars templating to `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` todos.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.
2. Follow the challenges from the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/tree/master/week-03-restful-server-express/day-03" target="_blank">CRUD Server Routes </a> modules. By the end of the challenges, **you should have:**
  * A RESTful API with server routes to "CRUD" todos
  * Request specs for each of your API routes
3. Once your API is finished, build a client for your app. **A user should be able to:**
  * See a list of all todos
  * Create a new todo
  * Update an existing todo
  * Delete an existing todo
4. Make sure to take advantage of Bootstrap for a good UX.

## Bonus

In addition to being able to update and delete a todo, build a way for a user to mark a todo as "done". You'll need:
  * A styling change on the client to indicate the todo is "done" (this should be persistent if the user refreshes the page)
  * A request (AJAX) to mark the todo as done (update it) on the server

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* At the end of the day, once you've finished the **challenges from both modules** and **built the client**, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
